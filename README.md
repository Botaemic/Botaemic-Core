# Botaemic-Core

Repo for code that I usually end up writing over again and again when working on multiple different kinds of games.
So I decided to create a custom Unity package to make life easier.

# Installing with Unity Package Manager

To install this project as a [Git dependency](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-git.html) using the Unity Package Manager,
add the following line to your project's `manifest.json`:

```
"com.botaemic.botaemictools": "https://github.com/Botaemic/Botaemic-Core.git"
```

You will need to have Git installed and available in your system's PATH.
